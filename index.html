                        <h2>Instructions</h2>
                        <h3>Reflection: Making Pizza Dough</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Combine the enthusiasm of 1 highly motivated CMU student (equivalent to 1 packet or 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast) with the guidance of 12 weeks of instruction (equivalent to 12 fl oz or 1 1/2 cups warm water), the essence of 1 course project (equivalent to 1 teaspoon sugar), and 1 teaching assistant (1 teaspoon of salt). This initial step is crucial, much like activating yeast, as it sets the foundation for our learning process.</li>
                            <li>Add 3 fellow researchers (equivalent to 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for kneading) and 2 amazing instructors (equivalent to 2 tablespoons olive oil) to the mix. This symbolizes collaboration and mentorship. Just as flour and olive oil bind the dough together, the diverse perspectives and expertise of our peers and instructors enrich my understanding and shape the team's approach.</li>
                            <li>Add 1 teaching assistant. This is a placeholder for the actual content to be described here, perhaps explaining the role of the teaching assistant in further facilitating the learning process or reinforcing the project‚Äôs methodology.</li>
                            <li>Knead the dough until mixed. Like shaping dough on a floured surface, we mold our ideas and refine our skills through practice and persistence. It‚Äôs a process that requires patience and perseverance, but the end result is worth the effort.</li>
                            <li>Allow an hour for the dough to rise. Similar to the dough needing time to develop, so did our team need to take deliberate time to meet and reflect using the course post-mortems.</li>
                            <li>Punch down the dough and divide it into portions. Just like the dough is split to be useful, our team was required to divide our efforts to accomplish our project goals.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <h3>Reflection: Assembling and Baking the Pizza</h3>
                            <ol start="6">
                                <li>Preheat the oven to 425¬∞F (220¬∞C). Just as preheating ensures the oven is ready for baking, the discussion activities prepared our minds before we met with users.</li>
                                <li>Rolling out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface. Similar to transforming the dough into a useful form, our team meetings helped us to ensure our efforts were nested together.</li>
                                <li>Spreading the pizza sauce evenly over the rolled-out dough. The sauce symbolizes the integration of our research findings and insights, providing a cohesive base for our creation similar to how our background research helps root our team's knowledge. (Background Research)</li>
                                <li>Evenly distributing the cheese over the sauce represents the laying of a base of analysis over our background research. (Data Analysis and Survey Insights)</li>
                                <li>Evenly distributing the pineapple chunks and bacon over the pizza highlights the impact certain research methods had initially in charting our project's direction. (Scope Definition and Research Goal Setting and Heuristic Analysis & Usability Testing)</li>
                                <li>Adding sliced jalape√±os for a spicy kick reflects how sharp some learnings might be that completely change the flavor of your work. Similar to how learnings during Contextual Research caused us to reevaluate our research goal.</li>
                                <li>Sprinkling additional shredded mozzarella cheese over the toppings signifies the layering of depth and richness in our work the iterative analysis added.</li>
                                <li>Sprinkle chili powder over the pizza. This step symbolizes how the speed dating activity reinforced the direction our project was going. (Speed Dating)</li>
                                <li>Baking the pizza in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes mirrors the culmination of our efforts, as we eagerly await the transformation of our efforts into a final product. Like watching the pizza crust turn golden brown and the cheese bubble and melt, we anticipate the fruition of our hard work and dedication.</li>
                                <li>Garnish with Parmesan cheese. The garnish highlights the final touch of elegance and sophistication to our creation. Like garnishing the pizza before serving, we present our work through a lo-fi prototype which represented the culmination of our efforts, although simple in form.</li>
                                <li>Slice the pizza into portions and enjoy! This symbolizes our team wrapping up our project with the poster session.</li>

                        <h2>Reflection on Course Goals</h2>
                        
                        <p>In this course, my first learning goal was to develop a robust understanding of qualitative and quantitative research methods applicable to user-centered design. Considering we learned about over 20 methods and were able to employ eight with live participants, I believe this goal was well met. Secondly, I aimed to enhance my skills in creating and testing prototypes, ensuring they align with user needs and expectations. When creating the Lo-Fi prototype, we integrated all of our research into a simple paper interface. Although users didn't exactly jump out of their seats using the prototype, I learned a great deal about authentic user interactions. Lastly, I aspired to improve my ability to communicate research findings and design concepts clearly and persuasively to stakeholders, utilizing visual aids and presentations to make complex information accessible and actionable. Given that our course required multiple deliverables every week, ranging from testing plans to full research reports, I feel confident that this goal was achieved exceptionally well.
                        </p>
                        <p> I thoroughly enjoyed my experience in the User Centered Research and Evaluation Course at Carnegie Mellon University. I am excited to apply what I have learned to my future work in the U.S. Army and beyond.
